                An Unconventional History of Poverty" by Muhammad Yunus: This
                book by Muhammad Yunus, the founder of Grameen Bank and a
                pioneer in the field of microfinance, provides a unique and
                thought-provoking perspective on poverty and its causes. Yunus
                argues that poverty is not inevitable and that it can be
                eliminated through social innovation and entrepreneurship.

                "The Poverty of Capitalism: Economic Meltdown and the Struggle
                for What Comes Next" by John Smith: This book by economist John
                Smith provides a critical analysis of the causes of poverty and
                the ways in which capitalism perpetuates it. Smith argues that
                only by fundamentally transforming the economic system can we
                hope to eradicate extreme poverty.

                in which the global aid industry perpetuates poverty and how it

                field and on-the-ground perspectives from individuals living in
